Spiralize Matrix
You are attempting to solve a Coding Contract. You have 10 tries remaining, after which the contract will self-destruct.


Given the following array of arrays of numbers representing a 2D matrix, return the elements of the matrix as an array in spiral order:

    [
        [13,31,33]
        [ 1,19,19]
        [48, 6,44]
        [ 2, 1,50]
        [36, 5,31]
        [10,29,39]
        [40,45,29]
    ]

Here is an example of what spiral order should be:

    [
        [1, 2, 3]
        [4, 5, 6]
        [7, 8, 9]
    ]

Answer: [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8 ,7, 4, 5]

Note that the matrix will not always be square:

    [
        [1,  2,  3,  4]
        [5,  6,  7,  8]
        [9, 10, 11, 12]
    ]

Answer: [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 11, 10, 9, 5, 6, 7]


If your solution is an empty string, you must leave the text box empty. Do not use "", '', or ``.
