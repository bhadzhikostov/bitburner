Array Jumping Game
You are attempting to solve a Coding Contract. You have 1 try remaining, after which the contract will self-destruct.


You are given the following array of integers:

2,8,5,3,6,1,3,10,5,2,8,9,0,0,9,0,10,10

Each element in the array represents your MAXIMUM jump length at that position. This means that if you are at position i and your maximum jump length is n, you can jump to any position from i to i+n.

Assuming you are initially positioned at the start of the array, determine whether you are able to reach the last index.

Your answer should be submitted as 1 or 0, representing true and false respectively.


If your solution is an empty string, you must leave the text box empty. Do not use "", '', or ``.
